Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are regions in fluids that remain "coherent" in some sense as the flow evolves through time. Examples include jet streams, eddies, and flow barriers. These structures tell us about how drifters, pollutants, temperature, and energy are moved by the fluid. LCSs have even been used to understand the mechanisms in blood flow that cause heart problems and to explain how jellyfish capture prey. In this talk, I will briefly introduce LCSs and discuss one of the most popular methods for extracting coherent structures; the finite-time Lyapunov exponent.
